# Fetal-Health-Classification
In this project, we use machine learning and deep learning to classify fetal health in terms of normal, suspect or pathological. 

Fetal health assessment is crucial during pregnancy to identify potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes. Traditional methods, while valuable, can be subjective and time-consuming. We investigate the use of various algorithms to analyze data collected through techniques like cardiotocography (CTG), focusing on features like fetal heart rate and uterine contractions.
